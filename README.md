# fastn-button

fastn buttons are developed using [fastn language](https://fastn.com/). To achieve fastn champion badge I have developed these buttons taking UI inspiration from [Matrrial UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-button/).

# Overview

Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.

Buttons communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed
throughout your UI, in places like:

- Modal windows
- Forms
- Cards
- Toolbars

These fastn buttons are inspired from [Matrrial UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-button/) and uses fastn typography and color tokens.
